# Statement by Matthias Köppe on the illegitimate actions of the Sage Code of Conduct Committee in October 2024
# (draft, TBD)

I am the principal de-facto maintainer of the SageMath project. I have been leading the project
since 2020: 
- **technologically** (as the [overall top code contributor](https://github.com/passagemath/passagemath/graphs/contributors), the principal maintainer of the Sage distribution, and as the designer and implementor of the modularization project, a renewal of Sage as a first-class member of the Python ecosystem); 
- **organizationally** (e.g., as principal maintainer of the continuous integration systems, by leading the migration from Trac to GitHub, and leading the creation of release notes); and 
- **morally** (e.g. with my 2024 essay series "(Re-)building an inclusive SageMath community", https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/bO6ZeK6MNSo/m/Pj0Hoaz2AwAJ).

On 2024-10-04, without any consultation with the community and in violation of our project's procedures, **the Sage Code of Conduct Committee (CoCC) abruptly suspended me from the Sage project**, for the duration of "a minimum of one year": https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/wkYfMA9ivYA

I am no longer able to post in any of the project's mailing lists, participate in the project's GitHub issues and pull requests; and my contributions to the project over the past decade have been erased from public view: https://github.com/sagemath/sage/graphs/contributors

The suspension was implemented and announced within hours of my calling out the CoCC for its severe misconduct and my call for accountability of the committee (https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/F9imWbwjPhE); the CoCC has not responded to my message, nor has it given any public justification for its actions.

This is the culmination of a severe crisis of the Sage community, in which the CoCC -- appointed by election only in early spring 2024 -- 
and its predecessor, the Sage Abuse Committee, have systematically refused to protect me from the persistent abuse by other developers, and instead took to a campaign of defamation against me. **At the core of this defamation campaign is a false neutrality that equates abuse with calling out abuse, refuses to distinguish between real harm and narcissistic injury, and demands that victims of abuse are nice to their abusers.** Not only has the CoCC systematically protected the abusers in the community: the methods of the committee have become indistinguishable from those of the abusers, e.g., gaslighting and playing the victim. The climate created by the committees by their actions -- and weaponized inaction -- has already encouraged other community members to openly display hostility and disrespect.

To what extent this crisis is based on general phenomena in toxic open source communities such as entitlement, jealousy, and narcissism, 
and to what extent it is based on the toxic subculture of prestige in pure mathematics is another question, but not a very important one.
Fundamentally, the crisis of the community is one driven by disrespect. 

**I am calling on the Sage community to:**
- remove the current Sage CoCC from office and reprimand its members for their severe misconduct;
- reinstate me as a member and as an owner of the SageMath project;
- engage in steps that affirm the principles of a healthy open source community and of good governance;
- appoint a new CoCC that operates on these well understood principles.

Meanwhile, my work on Sage continues: I have created a fork https://github.com/passagemath/passagemath, which is dedicated to developing pip-installable packages, a Pyodide port for serverless deployment with Javascript, and a native Windows port.

## The suspension notice, commented

I received the following [suspension notice](emails-sage-conduct/2024-10-04%20Gmail%20-%20Notice%20of%20suspension.pdf) from CoCC on 2024-10-04:

> Dear Matthias,
>
> Due to your continued unwillingness to acknowledge the negative impact your behavior has had on the
> Sage community, and your lack of cooperation in resolving conflicts with other Sage developers, we are
> suspending your participation in the Sage project.
>
> Specifically, we have
> - Removed your account from the SageMath GitHub organization and blocked it
> - Blocked your ability to post on all Sage-related Google groups.
>
> This suspension is effective immediately, and will last for a minimum of one year. If, after this period, you
> wish to return to contributing to the project, , you may request a review of this suspension by writing to the
> Code of Conduct Committee. At that time, you will need to demonstrate that you have made progress in
> addressing the concerns that we outlined in our previous communication and provide a plan for reconciling
> with the Sage developers with whom you have had conflicts over the past year.
>
> We are saddened to take this action, as we recognize and value the many contributions you have made to
> the project over the years.
>
> This is a unanimous decision by the Code of Conduct Committee, as with all previous decisions.
>
> The SageMath Code of Conduct Committee


The suspension notice appeared within hours of my calling out the CoCC for its severe misconduct and my call for accountability of the committee (https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/F9imWbwjPhE); the CoCC has not responded to that message, nor has it given any public justification for its actions.


A few days prior, the CoCC sent me an [email titled Addressing causes of concern in the Sage community](emails-sage-conduct/2024-10-01%20Gmail%20-%20Addressing%20causes%20of%20concern%20in%20the%20Sage%20community.pdf):


> Dear Matthias,
>
> In April, we shared with you that several Sage developers had left the project because of your behavior.

An unsubstantiated claim already then. The CoCC has no authority to act on denunciations.

> Since then, more developers have told us privately that they are considering leaving, and Martin Rubey has
> expressed this sentiment both publicly and privately.

M. Rubey's public displays of hostility against me are wildly inappropriate, and it was invited and normalized by the action and inaction of the CoCC.

> Some developers have told us that they are no longer
> encouraging new people to join the project. In all of these cases, your behavior is a primary reason.
> From the survey we conducted in July, we learned that many are worried about the atmosphere in the Sage
> community, especially the toxicity on sage-devel. From the responses in the survey as well as messages we
> received as the Code of Conduct Committee, we believe that you are often at the center of this toxicity.

That's just an insult from a corrupt and hostile committee that refuses to make a distinction between perpetrators and targets of abuse. As I have documented, I have been the **target** of abuse, displays of disrespect, and hostility.
The committee also willfully ignores that through my intense work on Sage over the past 4 years, I am at the center of all of Sage development.

> In addition, many of the responses to the survey mention your conflict with Dima as contributing to an
> unpleasant environment on sage-devel.
>
> The two of you have made no progress on reconciliation in over six
> months. We don’t need the two of you to be able to work together, but we do need the conflict between you
> two to not disrupt the functioning of the community as a whole.

The committee has not taken any of the necessary steps to address the persistent abuse from D. Pasechnik.

> We believe that Dima should, and would be willing to, apologize for his inappropriate language.

**This persistent minimization is abusive conduct by the committee.**

> However,
> we also believe that you should apologize for publicly describing him as an abuser, which is a term that
> insinuates much worse than the verbal abuse he has subjected you to. How would you de-escalate the
> conflict between the two of you?

**The CoCC is persistently equating abusive conduct and calling out abusive conduct. This is abusive conduct by the committee.**

> Similarly, we imagine that Martin would appreciate an apology for how you interacted with him. If that is not
> something you are willing to do, how do you propose making him feel more welcome in the Sage
> community?

This is gaslighting.

> We also want to be clear about the kinds of behaviors that we have observed from you that are problematic.
> You often behave dismissively toward other developers, trying to wave away comments that you disagree
> with. You have displayed an unwillingness to acknowledge the outcome of conflict resolution processes, for
> example trying to dismiss votes in sage-devel when you disagreed with the outcome. You have repeatedly
> claimed a leadership role in the Sage project. While leading by positive example is welcome,

I'll note that here again CoCC assumes that it has the authority to declare what is welcome.
But CoCC is not elected as a leadership committee.

> claiming
> authority over others’ behavior without any mandate from the community alienates other developers.
> Community members are frustrated by the condescending language that we have seen from you on
> numerous occasions.

The committee is embracing a standard technique by abusers, viz., playing the victim.

> We have communicated with you about many of these issues without making any progress. How will you
> change your behavior to improve the atmosphere in sage-devel, on GitHub, and in the Sage community as
> a whole?
> The SageMath Code of Conduct Committee
