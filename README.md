# Statement by Matthias KÃ¶ppe on the illegitimate actions of the Sage Code of Conduct Committee
# (draft, TBD)

I am the principal de-facto maintainer of the SageMath project. I have been leading the project
since 2020: **technologically** (as the overall top code contributor, the principal maintainer of the Sage distribution, and as the designer and implementor of the modularization project, a renewal of Sage as a first-class member of the Python ecosystem); **organizationally** (e.g., as prinicipal maintainer of the continuous integration systems); and **morally** (e.g. with my essay series "(Re-)building an inclusive SageMath community", https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/bO6ZeK6MNSo/m/Pj0Hoaz2AwAJ).

On 2024-10-04, without any consultation with the community, the Sage Code of Conduct Committee (CoCC) abruptly suspended
me from the Sage project, for the duration of "at least one year". I am no longer able to post in any of the project's forums. https://groups.google.com/g/sage-devel/c/wkYfMA9ivYA

This is the culmination of a severe crisis of the Sage community, in which the CoCC -- appointed by election only in early spring 2024 -- 
and its predecessor, the Sage Abuse Committee, systematically refused to protect me from the persistent abuse by other developers, and instead took to a campaign of defamation against me. Not only has the CoCC systematically protected the abusers in the community: the methods of the committee have become indistinguishable from those of the abusers.

To what extent this crisis is based on general phenomena in toxic open source communities such as entitlement, jealousy, and narcissism, 
and to what extent it is based on the toxic subculture of prestige in pure mathematics is another question, but not a very important one.

## Sage Abuse Committee's weaponized inaction

## Sage Abuse Committee's abuse of administrative power

and refusal to justify the basis of GitHub privilege changes


## Sage Abuse Committee manipulated the 2024 Sage CoCC elections

The Sage Abuse Committee inappropriately removed me from consideration for election for the CoCC, thus eliminating abuse victims' representation from the committee.

## Sage Code of Conduct Committee's weaponized inaction and uneven enforcement

## Sage Code of Conduct Committee's defamation of abuse victims

## Sage Code of Conduct Committee's denunciation of maintainer actions and leadership as misconduct
